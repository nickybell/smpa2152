# Write this vector using seq()
months <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12)

# Write this vector using rep()
days <- c(31,28,31,30,31,30,31,31,30,31,30,31)

# What class (type) is this object? (P.S. This object is always available in R.)
month.name

# Make a data frame containing columns for the months (by number and name) and the number of days in each month. (Hint: Look at how we made the data frame of Presidential inauguration temperatures)

# This year is a leap year. Change the number of days for February from 28 to 29 in your data frame.

# Create a new column called "weeks" that is the number of weeks in each month (divide the number of days by 7).
