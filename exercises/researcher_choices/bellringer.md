# Bellringer: Identifying Inferential Errors in Research

After reading the three articles on researcher choices, complete this worksheet by identifying solutions to the inferential errors described below. For each error, write your proposed solution in the right column.

## Instructions
- Read each inferential error carefully
- Think about what the researchers should have done differently
- Write your proposed solution in the space provided

| Inferential Error | Proposed Solution |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Measuring change**: The *FP* measured conscientiousness by comparing each age group's scores to where they would have fallen on the full population distribution in 2014, rather than just reporting the actual scores or the actual amount of change. This made it unclear what was actually being measured and made small changes appear more dramatic. | <br><br><br><br> |
| **Survey respondents**: The study on which the *FP* study was based used only people who volunteer to take surveys on the internet, who may be different from the general population. | <br><br><br><br> |
| **Changing definitions**: The way that maternal deaths were defined and recorded on death certificates changed over time - states gradually added a pregnancy checkbox and the definition expanded - making it appear that maternal deaths were increasing when really the measurement method was changing. | <br><br><br><br> |
| **Specific outcome selection**: The Geiers studied only 'atypical autism' (a less common subtype) without explaining why vaccines would affect this type and not autism more broadly. | <br><br><br><br> |
| **Comparison group timing**: The Geiers compared autism rates in children born between 1991-1998 to a comparison group of children born only in 1991-1992, even though the criteria for diagnosing autism changed significantly in 1994. | <br><br><br><br> |
| **Other explanations**: Children who see doctors more often are both more likely to get vaccines and more likely to have developmental concerns identified. | <br><br><br><br> |
