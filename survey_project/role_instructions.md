## Survey Designers

You have been assigned the role of a Survey Designer for the class project. Your role is to lead the class in generating ideas for survey questions, write the survey questions, write the survey form, and oversee a pre-test of the survey.

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.

 * At the beginning of class on October 6, I will provide you with 10 minutes to lead a class discussion of potential survey topics and/or questions. It is up to you to use this time wisely, so please plan ahead.
 
 * You must complete a draft of your survey questionnaire and email it to me by 5:00pm on October 7. Your survey questionnaire should take no longer than five minutes to complete (remember that survey takers will be verbally asking the questions to respondents). I will give you feedback on your draft that evening. (Please note that you are still responsible for completing your lab assignment by 11:59pm on October 7.)
 
 * At the beginning of class on October 8, I will provide you with time to pre-test the survey questionnaire with your colleagues and hear their feedback.
 
 * Your final draft of the questionnaire is due at 11:59pm on October 9. Please create your questionnaire so that the survey takers can easily record the responses from respondents. Submit your final questionnaire document to me by email. It must be in an editable form (Word document, Google Doc, etc.)
 
Satisfactory completion of the survey questionnaire will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!

## Principal Investigators

You have been assigned the role of a Principal Investigator for the class project. Your role is to write and revise a Human Subjects Protection Protocol for review by a student-led Institutional Review Board (IRB).

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.

 * I will email you the final questionnaire from the Survey Designers on October 10.
 
 * You must complete a draft of your Human Subjects Protection Protocol and email it to me by 11:59pm on October 13. I have uploaded a template for your protocol to your group's File Exchange on Blackboard. (Please note that you are still responsible for completing your lab assignment by 11:59pm on October 14.)
 
 * I will provide you with feedback on your draft on October 14.
 
 * Your final draft of the protocol is due at 11:59pm on October 16 and should be submitted to me by email. It must be in an editable form (Word document, Google Doc, etc.)
 
 * By October 20, the IRB will meet to review your protocol and provide you with their feedback. They will either accept your proposal, require revisions to your proposal, or reject your proposal. If the IRB requires revisions (as occurs in 99% of cases), you must complete your revisions by 5:00pm on October 22.
 
Satisfactory completion of the protocol will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

## IRB Members

You have been assigned the role of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) Member for the class project. Your role is to review and comment on the Human Subjects Protection Protocol, and ensure that the protocols are followed throughout the research process.

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.
 
 * I will email you the protocol document from the Principal Investigators on October 17.
 
 * By October 20 at 11:59pm, you must provide written comments to the Principal Investigators by email (copying me). You MUST meet in person or on Zoom to discuss the protocol and write your comments; asynchronous review is not permitted. At your meeting, you should elect a Chair who will communicate with the Principal Investigators.
 
 * Your feedback must be in an editable form (Word document, Google Doc, etc.) and should include feedback, positive or negative, on each section of the protocol. I have put a template for the protocol in your group's File Exchange on Blackboard. In addition, you must indicate whether you accept the proposal, require revisions to the proposal, or reject the proposal. In 99% of cases, the IRB requires revisions to the proposal. In the event of disagreements between committee members, you shall vote by majority rule, with ties broken by the Chair.
 
 * The Principal Investigators will respond to your request for revisions by 5:00pm on October 22. The IRB must then meet, in person or virtually, to review the revised submission and issue a final determination (no more written feedback is required). By October 23 at 11:59pm, you must provide your final determination to the Principal Investigators by email (copying me).
 
Satisfactory completion of the protocol will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

## Survey Managers

You have been assigned the role of a Survey Manager for the class project. Your role is to select the locations for collecting survey responses, create a schedule for survey takers, oversee survey collection, and input the survey data into a computerized format for analysis.

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.
 
 * Survey collection will occur from October 27 - October 30.
 
 * At the beginning of class on October 15, I will provide you with 10 minutes to lead a class discussion on potential survey collection locations and times. It is up to you to use this time wisely, so please plan ahead.
 
 * At the beginning of class on October 20, I will provide you with time at the beginning of class to coordinate sign-ups for survey collection times. There are 19 students in the class (including yourselves), and each student should expect to work as a survey taker for one 90-minute shift. Shifts should consist of 2-3 students at a time (no one is permitted to work alone under any circumstances).
 
 * I will provide access to survey forms, clipboards, pens, etc. You do not need to worry about this part.
 
 * It is your responsibility to collect the completed survey forms from each survey taker and to enter this data into a computerized format. You may request that students put their completed forms in my mailbox in SMPA. I recommend entering the data into a Google Sheet and using numbers rather than words to record survey answers.
 
 * By 11:59pm on November 2, you should send me the final sheet with all of the survey responses recorded, as well as a codebook (a document indicating what the numeric values in each column represent). I will provide you with an editable version of the survey form to make this a bit easier. 
 
Satisfactory completion of these tasks will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!
