## Survey Designers

You have been assigned the role of a Survey Designer for the class project. Your role is to lead the class in generating ideas for survey questions, write the survey questions, create the data codebook, and oversee a pre-test of the survey.

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.

At the beginning of class on March 16, I will provide you with 10 minutes to lead a class discussion of potential survey topics and/or questions. It is up to you to use this time wisely, so please plan ahead.

You must complete a draft of your survey questionnaire and email it to me by 11:59pm on March 17. Your survey questionnaire should take no longer than five minutes to complete (remember that survey takers will be verbally asking the questions to respondents). I will give you feedback on your draft that evening.

At the beginning of class on March 18, I will provide you with time to pre-test the survey questionnaire with your colleagues and hear their feedback.

Your final draft of the questionnaire is due at 11:59pm on March 19. Please create your questionnaire so that the survey takers can easily record the responses from respondents.

You must also submit a Codebook along with the questionnaire. This is a simple document listing every question variable (e.g., Q1_Age) and the numeric values for the answers (e.g., Male=0, Female=1). The Field Operations team cannot enter data without this.

Submit your final questionnaire and Codebook to me by email. They must be in an editable form (Word document, Google Doc, etc.).

Satisfactory completion of the survey questionnaire and codebook will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!

## Principal Investigators

You have been assigned the role of a Principal Investigator for the class project. Your role is to write and revise a Human Subjects Protection Protocol for review by the Field Operations Team (acting as the IRB), and to write the Surveyor Script.

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.

I will email you the final questionnaire from the Survey Designers on March 20.

You must complete a draft of your Human Subjects Protection Protocol and email it to me by 11:59pm on March 22. I have uploaded a template for your protocol to your group's File Exchange on Blackboard.

Along with the protocol, you must draft a "Surveyor Script" - a one-page script telling your classmates exactly how to introduce the survey and obtain verbal consent in the field.

I will provide you with feedback on your draft on March 23.

Your final draft of the protocol and script is due at 11:59pm on March 25 and should be submitted to me by email. It must be in an editable form (Word document, Google Doc, etc.).

By March 27, the Field Operations Team will review your protocol and provide you with their feedback. They will either accept your proposal, require revisions to your proposal, or reject your proposal. If they require revisions (as occurs in 99% of cases), you must complete your revisions by 11:59pm on March 29.

Satisfactory completion of the protocol will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!

## Field Operations Team

You have been assigned the role of a Field Operations Team member for the class project. Your role is three-fold: 1) Act as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) to review the safety protocol, 2) Manage the survey collection schedule, and 3) Oversee data entry.

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.

Logistics: At the beginning of class on March 23, I will provide you with 10 minutes to lead a class discussion on potential survey collection locations. At the beginning of class on March 25, I will provide you with time to coordinate sign-ups for survey collection times. It is your responsibility to ensure every shift is filled.

IRB Review: I will email you the protocol document from the Principal Investigators on March 25. By March 27 at 11:59pm, you must provide written comments to the Principal Investigators by email (to me). You MUST meet in person or on Zoom to discuss the protocol and write your comments.

Final Determination: The Principal Investigators will respond to your request for revisions by 11:59pm on March 29. You must then meet to review the revised submission. By March 31 at 11:59pm, you must provide your final determination to the Principal Investigators by email (to me).

Data Entry: Survey collection will occur from April 1 – April 3. As the surveys come in, it is your responsibility to enter the data into a computerized format.

You must set up a Google Sheet using the Codebook provided by the Survey Designers.

You must type the responses from the paper surveys into this sheet.

By 5:00pm on April 5, you should send me the final sheet with all of the survey responses recorded so it is ready for the lab session the next morning.

Satisfactory completion of these tasks will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!

## Survey Analysts

You have been assigned the role of a Survey Analyst for the class project. Your role is to analyze the data using R and write a 500-word op-ed using the survey results for submission to the The GW Hatchet.

You have access to the Groups tab on Blackboard to find your fellow group members and their email addresses. Please let me know if you are unable to see this information on Blackboard.

On April 6, the entire class will complete a lab assignment using the survey results. Each student will design their own analysis using the data.

At the beginning of class on April 8, I will provide you with 10 minutes to lead a class discussion on potential survey analyses for the op-ed. It is up to you to use this time wisely, so please plan ahead.

By 11:59pm on April 11, you should send me a draft of your op-ed as well as the R code used to generate your analyses. I will provide you with feedback on April 12. This op-ed should be a collaborative effort between group members; you will all be on the by-line.

By 11:59pm on April 14, you should send me the final draft of your op-ed as well as confirmation that you have submitted the op-ed for consideration by the Hatchet (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfQljf0MAJA6as7zb_rYJwCknM6lbTodP0vFT-Bu3mvX6pfzA/viewform).

Satisfactory completion of the op-ed will earn you full credit for 50% of your class project grade (i.e., this is a pass/fail part of the assignment).

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns, and good luck!
