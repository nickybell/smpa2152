    \item \textbf{Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)}: Observations are missing for non-systematic reasons

    \begin{itemize}
        \item MAR data can be resolved using a statistical technique called ``weighting'' in which answers from less-responsive groups are counted more, and answers from more-responsive groups are counted less
        \item Like making a ``public opinion soup'' but can go wrong (e.g., LA Times)
    \end{itemize}
    \item<6-> \textbf{Missing Not at Random (MNAR)}: Missing outcomes are correlated with the outcome that is being measured
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<7-> MNAR data is a challenge because the only thing that predicts what data is missing is the fact that it is missing
