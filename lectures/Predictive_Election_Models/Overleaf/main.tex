Election prediction models must decide:
    \begin{itemize}[<+(2)->]
        \item What polls to include (and how much to weight them): quality, quantity, sample size, time, etc.
        \item How to adjust polls for house effects and/or mode effects
        \item How to quantify the uncertainty in poll results
        \item<7-> How to model election outcomes (e.g, intra-state correlation)
        \item<8-> How to communicate probabilities
    \end{itemize}
