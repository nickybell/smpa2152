\frame{\frametitle{Expectations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{An A effort}: Starts homework early and asks questions/attends office hours; reviews the professor's feedback; reads assignment instructions and grading rubrics carefully; attends class; being perfect at coding is not an expectation of an A effort.
    \item \textbf{A B effort}: Completes all homework assignments; does not carefully read assignment instructions; uses outside resources to complete the homework; attends class; a B effort meets minimum expectations.
    \item \textbf{A C effort or lower}: Does not complete all homework assignments; does not carefully read assignment instructions; does not communicate with the professor; does not consistently attend class; I will reach out if you meet these criteria.
\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\frame{\frametitle{When You Get Stuck}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Look back at the lecture materials. Everything required to complete the homework is in the lecture materials.
    \item Google the error (this is different than Googling ``how do I do X?'').
    \item Email the professor. Be sure to include enough code in your email that I can recreate the problem. 
\end{enumerate}
