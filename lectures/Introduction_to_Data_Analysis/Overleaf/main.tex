~\\
~\\
\begin{tabular}{l|l}
Attendance & 10\% \\
\hline
Lab assignments & 35\% \\

\frame{\frametitle{Lab Assignments}

\only<1-5>{
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item You will receive a very basic introduction to the R statistical programming language
        \item There are seven in-class Lab Days where you will work on an assignment applying the lessons learned in class to real-world problems using R
        \item You must watch the video lectures on R prior to the Lab Day class.
        \item You must turn in your completed lab assignment by 11:59pm the next day.
        \item You may complete these assignments on your own or in collaboration with other students. This means that you may work together to write code and/or solve problems. \textbf{Do not split up the questions or combine independent work.} Each student must submit an assignment on Blackboard.
    \end{itemize}
}
\only<6>{
    There is a software requirement for this course. Students may select from either option below.
    \vspace{1em}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Option 1: Positron}. Positron is a free, open source development environment for R (and other coding languages) developed by the same creators of Posit Cloud.
        \item \textbf{Option 2: Posit Cloud}. Posit Cloud is a web-based version of the popular R development environment RStudio. At the time of this writing, a Student account for Posit Cloud costs \$5 per month.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item You will conduct a survey of your fellow GW students
    \item You will have an opportunity to indicate your preference for different roles in the survey process
    \item Your grade consists of your successful participation in the process plus a Lab Day assignment which uses the survey data you collect.
    \item You must complete the assigned CITI Ethics training to participate in the class project.
