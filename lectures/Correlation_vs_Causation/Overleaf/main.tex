        \item Causation depends on knowing the \textbf{counterfactual}: if we did not observe a change in the value of the explanatory variable, we would not observe a change in the value of the outcome variable

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Home-field advantage is real (when fans are there).
        \item Women who rest more and were exposed to fewer stressors, pollutants and viruses have fewer premature births.
        \item Dolphins whistle longer, birds change their songs, and sea turtles lay more eggs when humans aren't around.

For any given case, we observe the outcome variable with \textit{either} a change in the independent variable or no change in the independent variable, but not both.

\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item In other words, we do not observe the counterfactual
    \item But we try out best to observe the counterfactual using \textbf{experiments}
    \item Experiments establish a counterfactual by comparing cases that differ only in the explanatory variable that we are interested in

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item A critical element of experiments is that the cases are assigned to the \textbf{treatment} group (e.g., getting a drug) and \textbf{control} group (e.g., getting a placebo) completely at random
    \item Recall the definition of a \textbf{random sample}: the probability of any given unit being drawn from the population is uniform (the same)
    \item The intuition for randomness is that there is no \textbf{selection bias}: patients aren't getting the drug because they are younger or healthier, for example.

\begin{itemize}[<+(3)->]
    \item But wait: were households in London assigned to either the Southwark \& Vauxhall Company or the Lambeth Company completely at random?
    \item No. This is called a natural experiment, and it relies on whether we believe being in either group is as-good-as-random.
    \item<7-> Finding natural experiments in the real world is really difficult, so we often design our experiments in controlled settings like laboratories or surveys
    \item<8-> We only have a true experiment where the \underline{researcher} randomly assigns cases to treatment or control.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item What about when we don't have an experiment, but instead are collecting \textbf{observational data} from the world?
    \item Then we face the fundamental problem of causal inference. Correlation does not imply causation.
    \item But all hope is not lost - we just have to be much more careful about threats to causal inference: \textbf{confounders} and \textbf{reverse causation}.
