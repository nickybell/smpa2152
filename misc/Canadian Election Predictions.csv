"1","Provide your prediction for the Canadian Federal Election to be held on April 28, 2025. Each party should be assigned a popular vote percentage (not number of seats in Parliament).Liberal: [lib]Conservative: [cons]Bloc Quebecois: [bq]New Democratic: [nd]","40,32,4,2","2","What information did you use for this forecast? Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","- Polymarket\n- 2019 &amp; 2021 results\n- Recent news media from CBC, BBC, and American outlets (NYT, Bloomberg)\n<a href=""https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/federal_election/2025-federal-election-scenarios"">- National Post Apr. 2 prediction</a>\n<br>\nI chose these sources because I believe that they are the most accessible metrics four weeks out. With international volatility and an electorate that is shifting by the day, it is difficult to make any kind of prediction at this time. I referenced 2019 &amp; 2021 election results because of their proximity to the first Trump era and also leaned on the Polymarket because it tends to form the aggregate/consensus for numerous election scenarios. News media and polling on that end is also useful to establish the context under which voters are going to mobilize on election day.","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","Because it's not &quot;technically&quot; a model, but rather an aggregate of established online trends, that in itself is a limitation. However, I will also contend that much will change as part of the tariff discussion and international issues will also be a tremendous driver in this election cycle. It is difficult to assess their impact this far out."

Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","I used the CBC News Poll Tracker because it had the poll displayed in an digestable/understanable manner for someone who doesn't know anything about their elections and they had explanations for how they gathered their data/made the prediction. ","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","One limit may be explainability, where it is difficult to decipher why the machine makes the predictions that it does. "

Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","I used polling information from CBC News and current trends in the past few days to predict the likelihood of fluctuations. I chose this site because it has a large sample size and historical polling information, so they are more likely to be able to predict possible errors in their polls and poll questions. ","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","A limitation of this, though, is that it may rely too heavily on historical data and inaccurately assume that past trends will repeat themselves when in reality, that may not be the case. "

Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","I used CBC's poll tracker here: <a href=""https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/"">https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/</a>\n<br>\nI just changed the numbers with the trend arrows underneath each percentage provided as well as guessing who I thought would win. It seems abundantly clear that Mark Carney will win the election with the liberal party. I and clearly many other people - it's the first result in Google - trust CBC as a reliable source for election information, which is why I decided to base my predictions off of them. There is no analysis or predictions on it, just the live numbers and the percent change from the first of each month.","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","My model is based on complete guesses. The data that I used are accurate facts, but my inference is based entirely on chance. That doesn't give me complete confidence in my answer but I'm not doing election predictions for a living so I'm allowed to guess. Still more accurate than a dart throwing monkey. I also know that the data I used as of April 2 is only based on change tracked from April 1. The totals are all over the course of the entire poll, but as I said above, the change arrows are based on the first of each month and one day isn't much time to accurately measure the trends for each party's voting numbers."

Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","The information I used to make these predictions was 338Canada. It is a website providing projects for Canadian elections which they have just done for the upcoming 2025 elections.&nbsp;\n<a href=""https://338canada.com/"">https://338canada.com/</a>","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","338Canada says its methodology uses a mostly proportional swing model. Specifically, it looks at demographics relating to people's language, age, household income, population density, education levels, immigration/citizenship status, and socioeconomic status. However, it also lacks other demographic data, such as whether the person being polled is part of a family or what industry they work in. Missing this other demographic data relevant to how they decide to vote might be a limitation in how 338Canada predicts elections.<br>"

Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","I contacted a friend of mine who studies Canadian political elections. We talked about how people like Silverman have made a career out of being really good at predicting elections, so if I win the extra credit it will prove further than election prediction modeling is not always the best, and an individual can get things right or close as well. ","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","It has very few sources, that could also be skewed by which parties he likes more. Which is similar to any other election prediction modeling. "

Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","I used poll trackers from CBC News and 338Canada, a statistical model of electoral projections based on opinion polls, electoral history, and demographic data.  I chose these sources because they are widely recognized for their accuracy and transparency in Canadian political analysis. CBC News is a trusted national broadcaster with nonpartisan reporting, while 338Canada specializes in election forecasting using historical data, demographic modeling, and polling averages. ","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","A key limitation of my forecasting model is that it relies heavily on public polling data, which can be affected by sampling bias, undecided voters, and last-minute shifts in voter behavior. Polls are snapshots in time and may not fully capture how people actually vote on election day."

Why did you choose the information and information sources that you did?","I used mainly Canadian networks as my sources to choose my information. I chose them because Canadian News channels cover the elections more and have more information because they have established reputations for accuracy and reliability in Canadian political polling. I used CBC News, the National Post, and Nanos Research.","3","What might be a limitation of your forecasting model currently?","One weakness of this prediction model is that it relies on polling data from a specific moment in time, reflecting voter intentions at that point. However, voter preferences can change quickly due to campaign events, political developments, or new issues. Polling methods and sample sizes can also introduce errors or bias. So, while these projections give a snapshot based on current data, they may not accurately predict the final election results."
