### R packages
* [`{afterthoughts}`](https://ccani007.github.io/afterthoughts/index.html) - automatic prompts for student reflection in coding work
* [`{learnr}`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/): interactive tutorials for R, see also [https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/121](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/121)

### Images
* `nyt_county_shift_*.png`: [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/05/25/us/politics/trump-politics-democrats.html) graphics showing that more counties shifting red than blue, but misses the context of the data: counties are not equally weighted

### Lecture materials
* [Linear regression explainer](https://mlu-explain.github.io/linear-regression/)

### Readings
* [Dan Sinker's blog, "The Who Cares Era"](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/): maybe useful if talking about role of AI in the course because it is more general, not just about coding

### Other
* *Coded Bias*: 2021 documentary about bias in facial recognition AI
