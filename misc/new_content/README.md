## Possible Content for Future Courses

### R packages
* [`{afterthoughts}`](https://ccani007.github.io/afterthoughts/index.html) - automatic prompts for student reflection in coding work
* [`{learnr}`](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/): interactive tutorials for R, see also [https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/121](https://github.com/coatless/quarto-webr/issues/121)
* [`{gwalkr}`](https://github.com/Kanaries/GWalkR) is an interactive tool for data visualizations that runs in the RStudio IDE

### Images
* `pew_opt_in_young_people.png`: 12% of younger respondents in opt-in samples say that they are licensed to operate a submarine :)
* `fireworks_injuries.jpeg` (from Vox) and `ufo_sightings.png` (from Economist): both great examples of confounders (July -> DV confounded by July 4 fireworks)
* `catholic_church_attendance.jpeg`: good example of selection bias - weak Catholics are selecting out of the Catholic sample

### Lecture materials
* [Linear regression explainer](https://mlu-explain.github.io/linear-regression/)
* On observational vs. experimental data: observational data suggests that female instructors face bias from students on semester evals, but experimental data [suggests otherwise](https://x.com/JohnHolbein1/status/1861964761086459957)
* [David Byler](https://www.vox.com/2024-elections/370649/trust-polls-2016-2020-election-2024-pollster-polling-miss): "We're just not in a world where polls provide that kind of 100 percent, 0 percent win probability. You can get odds, you can get probabilities, you can get sort of levels of certainty. But we're in an incredibly polarized moment, and [polling] is just not a precision tool that can provide certainty."
* [Pretty amazing graphs](https://graphics.wsj.com/infectious-diseases-and-vaccines/) about how the introduction of a vaccine (a sort of natural experiment) led to precipitous declines in disease rates.
* NORC is using [satellite imagery](https://www.norc.org/research/library/accurate-affordable-survey-sampling-method-satellite-imagery.html) to enhance their survey frames derived from USPS address data
* [Visual explanation](https://haswal.github.io/pivot/) of pivot_longer()
* YouGov shows that even the way we design [matrix questions](https://business.yougov.com/content/52629-the-effect-of-question-format-on-partisan-support-for-bans) can impact responses.
* [Pew Research Center](https://www.pewresearch.org/decoded/2025/07/23/why-and-how-were-weighting-surveys-for-past-presidential-vote/) is now weighting by recalled vote!
* [Survey160](https://www.survey160.com/methodological-research-blog/the-limits-of-simulation-in-public-opinion-research) blog post on synthetic poll respondents
* Evidence from [NORC](https://www.norc.org/content/dam/norc-org/pdf2024/CPSS-Research-Brief-8-Professional-Respondents-In-Nonprobability-Panels.pdf) that non-probability panel respondents are "professional respondents"
* Examples of [natural experiments](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/11/upshot/covid-lessons.html) from the COVID-19 pandemic

### Readings
* [Dan Sinker's blog, "The Who Cares Era"](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/): maybe useful if talking about role of AI in the course because it is more general, not just about coding
* The rise in reported maternal mortality rates in the US is largely due to a change in measurement ([Our World In Data](https://ourworldindata.org/rise-us-maternal-mortality-rates-measurement))
* [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/102346/principles-for-advancing-equitable-data-practice_0.pdf)'s "Principles for advancing equitable data practice"
* Fun story about the [climate change warming stripes graph](https://chezvoila.com/blog/warmingstripes/): speaks to data viz engineers vs. designers
* [Opinion piece from Jennifer Benz](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/americans-are-moody-and-pollsters-should-pay-attention/) on the value of polling beyond the horse race

### Other
* *Coded Bias*: 2021 documentary about bias in facial recognition AI
* [Brendan Nyhan](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/sites.dartmouth.edu/dist/5/2293/files/2025/04/experiments-syllabus-2025.pdf) has his students take surveys on some online platforms and then report back
* Guide to [interpreting regression tables](https://nathanfavero.substack.com/regression-in-500-words)

### Miscellaneous thoughts
* "Plot rates, not counts."
* Consider magazines like *Significance*, *CHANCE*, and *Nightingale*
