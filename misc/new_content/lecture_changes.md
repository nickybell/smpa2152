## Changes to make to lecture slides

* images for machine learning lecture
* consider a revision to data viz science
* updated data graphs for polling I
* correlation vs. causation: add Spurious Correlation and ChatGPT explanations
* correlation vs. causation: better graphs for positive and negative correlation
* add lecture on outliers or something else b/c hypothesis testing not doing it
* predictive election models feels short
* regression lecture should no longer start with t-test
* wrapping up needs new QR code
